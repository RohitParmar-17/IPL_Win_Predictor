# IPL_Win_Predictor
The IPL cricket win predictor application predicts the percentage chance of winning for both teams based on specific match conditions. It leverages two datasets: matches and deliveries. A machine learning model is trained using both datasets to make predictions. The application is built using Streamlit, allowing users to interact with it through a user-friendly interface.
